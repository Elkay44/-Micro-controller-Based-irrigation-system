This Arduino sketch is designed for an ESP8266 microcontroller and serves the purpose of monitoring and controlling various sensors, including a DHT11 temperature and humidity sensor, a soil moisture sensor, and a DS18B20 temperature sensor. It communicates with the Blynk platform to facilitate remote sensor data visualization and control. Here's a detailed description of the code:

Libraries and Includes: The code begins by including several libraries, such as Blynk, SimpleTimer, DHT, OneWire, and DallasTemperature. These libraries enable communication with sensors and the Blynk platform.

Variables and Constants: The code defines essential variables and constants, including Blynk authentication, Wi-Fi credentials (SSID and password), pin assignments, sensor thresholds, and relay control pin.

sendSensor() Function: This function is responsible for reading data from the DHT11 sensor, which measures humidity and temperature. It checks for data validity and sends these readings to the Blynk app for remote monitoring. Additionally, it attempts to read data from a soil sensor (though there is a variable 's' used in virtualWrite which is not defined in the code).

setup() Function: This function initializes the ESP8266 device, sets pin modes for various sensors and relay control, and begins serial communication for debugging and communication with the DHT sensor. It configures a timer to periodically call the sendSensor() function for sensor data updates and initializes the DallasTemperature library for the DS18B20 sensor.

sendTemps() Function: This function reads analog data from A0 and requests temperature data from the DS18B20 sensor. It then sends these temperature readings to the Blynk app for remote monitoring.

loop() Function: The main loop function continuously runs and performs the following tasks:

Handles Blynk communication and executes timed functions using the timer.
Calls the sendTemps() function to update temperature readings and sends them to Blynk.
Reads the state of the soil moisture sensor and takes actions based on its state:
If the soil is dry (sensorState is 1 and lastState is 0) and the limit is below 300, it sends a notification to water the plants and turns on the water valve.
If the soil is already wet (sensorState is 1 and lastState is 1), it indicates that the valve is not open.
Otherwise, it turns off the water valve and logs that the valve is closed.
The code effectively integrates multiple sensors, enabling remote monitoring of environmental conditions and plant watering control through the Blynk platform.
